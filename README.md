Moskowitz (2016) 1. Your output should be from 1927-2017.

2. Define the monthly momentum portfolio decile of each stock as defined by both Daniel and Moskowitz (2016) and Kenneth R. French. Your output should be from 1927-2017.

3. Calculate the monthly momentum portfolio decile returns as defined by both Daniel and Moskowitz (2016) and Kenneth R. French. Your output should be from 1927-2017.

4. Replicate Table 1 in Daniel and Moskowitz (2016), except for alpha, t(alpha), beta, and sk(d) rows, and the Market column. Match the format and methodology to the extent possible.
